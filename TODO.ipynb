    "- Finding the subproblem in dynamic problem problems\t\n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced - binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. \t\n",
    "- Graphs: Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons.\n",

    "You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means.\n",

    "* Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work.\n",
    "* Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. \n",
